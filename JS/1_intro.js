------------------------------------------------- Namaste Javascript -----------------------------------------------------------

✨ Everything in java script happens inside an Execution context

📌 Execution Context
   → Environment where JS code runs.

Contains:

         ✨Memory                                            ✨Code 
(Variables & Functions stored)                             (Lines executed)  

📌 Memory Phase                                           📌 Code Execution Phase
→ Variables stored as undefined                            → Code runs line by line
→ Functions stored completely                              → Variables get assigned values
                                                           → Functions executed

✨ JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language.

📌 Thread of Execution
→ Code runs one line at a time

📌 Synchronous
→ One task finishes before next starts

📌 Single-Threaded
→ Only one line runs at a time
→ Runs in order (top to bottom)
→ No parallel execution

📌 Call Stack
→ Keeps track of function calls
→ Works on LIFO (Last In First Out)
